'''
I think I made this because I was trying to wrap my head around using dictionaries in Python. Anyway it's a little fun game. Pick a character, pick an atrribute, the computer picks a character at random and compares the value of the attribute you've picked for both characters. Larger number wins, simple. 

You can also add characters and give them custom attributes if you want. Enjoy.
